Implemented WMS using MERN stack. 

Added Admin, Seller and Client functionality. 

### OOAD pattern used: 

MVC Pattern - We have written routes which act as Controllers. These controllers interact with Models which consists of the Schema of our database and the database logic which calls DAO methods for MongoDB. The API's are the view.

Data Access Object Pattern - Mongoose which is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

Strategy Pattern - To implement the login functionality we used Passport which is Express-compatible authentication middleware for Node.js.

### Instructions to Run : 

Run server.js from the backend folder. 

Run test.py to execute API testcases. 

Refer Insomnia.json to view API's
